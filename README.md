### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Heorhii Shvab, a junior Front-End developer (Full stack developer)

For two and a half years I have been practicing non-commercial web development.
I specialise in full-stack technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, NextjJs and NodeJs/Express. I have also worked with databases such as SQL(PostgreSQL) and MongoDB(Mongoose).
You can find more on my social networks.

I got programming skills thanks to self-learning as well as web development courses including Meta's Front-End Developer Program and Harvard's Programming for Web Developers.

During the last two and a half years, I have completed dozens of pet-projects.
The best of them you can find here, on my GitHub. One of my project I am especially proud of is Statif. It is really useful and was mentioned in the article from dev.ua.

I am also a student of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. Thanks to my major, I have experience in working with GIS systems.
